# student-login-register
In my VS Code terminal, I ran the command node app.js, and my MongoDB connected successfully. Then, I opened http://localhost:3000/studentregistersystem.html and http://localhost:3000/studentloginsystem.html in Chrome and got the output successfully.

I have also uploaded all my project files and presentation (PPT) to GitHub. Here is the link: https://github.com/MatheswariD/student-login-register

http://localhost:3000, When you click the link, it will take you to my GitHub repository where all the files are available.

Thank you
